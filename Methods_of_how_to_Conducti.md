# How to Conduct
First you must add a valid target IP address in the simulation script and run ICMP_Flood_simulation.py and use Wireshark to capture traffic on the local network
Save this .pcap or .pcapng file and name it whatever you want.
Make sure to keep track of the file path and name.
Add the file path and name into the ICMP_Flood_detection.py script and run it. Make sure your threshold is a value you are ok with
Good Luck!
